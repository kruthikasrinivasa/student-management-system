# 🎓 Student Management System

A full-stack Student Management System built using the MERN Stack for managing student records through a modern, responsive dashboard.

The application provides complete CRUD operations, student search, course and year filtering, form validation, duplicate Student ID protection, and persistent data storage using MongoDB Atlas.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Student Management System is a web-based application developed to simplify and organize student record management.

The system allows users to:

- Add new student records
- View student records
- Edit existing student information
- Delete student records
- Search students using multiple fields
- Filter students by course
- Filter students by academic year
- Apply combined filters
- Validate required student information
- Prevent duplicate Student IDs
- Store and retrieve student data from MongoDB

The project follows a full-stack architecture where the React frontend communicates with the Node.js and Express.js backend through REST APIs using Axios.

---

## 🚀 Live Demo

The Student Management System is deployed and accessible online.

### Read

Student records are retrieved from MongoDB through the Express REST API and displayed in the Student Directory.

### Update

Users can select the edit button for an existing student, modify the information, and save the changes.

The updated data is sent using a PUT request and stored in MongoDB.

### Delete

Users can delete an existing student record through the delete button.

A confirmation message is displayed before the record is removed.

---

## 🔗 REST API

### Local Development Base URL

```text
http://localhost:5000/api/students
```

### Production Base URL

```text
https://student-management-api-qjhd.onrender.com/api/students
```

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint            | Description                 |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/students`     | Retrieve all students       |

## 👨‍🎓 Student Data Model

Each student record contains the following fields:

| Field      | Type   | Required | Description               |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------- |
| Student ID | String | Yes      | Unique student identifier |
| Name       | String | Yes      | Student's full name       |
| Email      | String | Yes      | Student email address     |
| Phone      | String | Yes      | Student phone number      |
| Course     | String | Yes      | Student's course          |
| Year       | String | Yes      | Academic year             |

### Supported Courses

* CSE
* ECE
* EEE
* DS

### Supported Academic Years

* Year 1
* Year 2
* Year 3
* Year 4

---

## 🔍 Search and Filtering

The Student Directory provides a search feature that allows users to search student records by:

* Student ID
* Name
* Email
* Course

The application also provides filters for:

* Course
* Academic Year

Course and year filters can be applied together to narrow down the displayed student records.

---

## ✅ Validation

Validation is implemented to improve data quality and prevent invalid student records.

### Frontend Validation

The student form checks that all required fields are completed before submission.

If required fields are missing, the user receives an error message.

### Backend Validation

The Mongoose schema validates:

* Required fields
* Unique Student ID
* Allowed courses
* Allowed academic years

### Duplicate Student ID

Student IDs are configured as unique.

If a duplicate Student ID is submitted, the backend returns an appropriate validation message and prevents duplicate records from being created.

---

## 🧪 Testing

The application was tested for the following functionality:

* Add Student
* View Students
* Edit Student
* Delete Student
* Search by Student Name
* Search by Student ID
* Search by Email
* Search by Course
* Course Filter
* Year Filter
* Combined Course + Year Filter
* Empty-field Validation
* Duplicate Student ID Validation
* MongoDB Data Persistence
* Data Persistence After Browser Refresh
* Live Deployment Testing

All core CRUD, search, filtering, validation, database persistence, and deployment functionality was tested successfully.

## 🔐 Security

Sensitive database configuration is handled through environment variables and is not committed to the public repository.

Sensitive credentials should never be committed to GitHub.

The repository's `.gitignore` is configured to prevent sensitive environment configuration from being tracked.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kruthikasrinivasa/student-management-system.git
```

Navigate into the project:

```bash
cd student-management-system
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

Navigate to the client directory:

```bash
cd client
```

Install the required packages:
